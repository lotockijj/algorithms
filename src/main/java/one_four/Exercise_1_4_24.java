package one_four;/*Throwing eggs from a building. Suppose that you have an N-story building and
plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg is broken if it is thrown off floor F or higher,
and unhurt otherwise. First, devise a strategy to determine the value of F such that the
number of broken eggs is ~lg N when using ~lg N throws, then find a way to reduce the
cost to ~2lg F.*/
