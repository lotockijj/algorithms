Show, in the style of the figures in this section, a detailed trace of TwoColor for finding a two-coloring
of the graph built by Graphâ€™s input stream constructor for the file tinyGex2.txt (see Exercise 4.1.2).
What is the order of growth of the running time of the TwoColor constructor, in the worst case?

Order of growth is E + V (Edges + Vertexes)
