4.1.11
Draw the tree represented by edgeTo[] after the call bfs(G, 0) in Algorithm 4.2 for the graph built by
Graphâ€™s input stream constructor for the file tinyGex2.txt (see Exercise 4.1.2).

4.1.12
What does the BFS tree tell us about the distance from v to w when neither is at the root?
It only tells that they are connected.
